  2. Neurons and Neuroglia
  3. Central Nervous System (CNS)
  4. Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
  5. Clinical Cases

## Divisions of the Nervous System
- **Anatomical Divisions**:
  - **Central Nervous System (CNS)**: Comprises the brain and spinal cord.
  - **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**: Includes cranial nerves (12 pairs) and spinal nerves (31 pairs).
  
  - **Subdivisions of PNS**:
    - **Autonomic Nervous System**: 
      - **Sympathetic Division**
      - **Parasympathetic Division**
    - **Somatic Nervous System**:
      - **Sensory Nervous System**
      - **Motor Nervous System**

- The PNS serves as a link between the CNS and the rest of the body.

## Neurons and Glial Cells
- **Neurons**: 
  - Functional and structural units of the nervous system.
  - Specialized for electrical signaling and impulse transmission.
  
- **Types of Neurons**:
  - **Bipolar Neurons**: Two processes; found in sensory organs (e.g., retina).
  - **Pseudo-unipolar Neurons**: One process that splits; found in sensory ganglia of PNS.
  - **Multipolar Neurons**: Multiple dendrites; most common type, found in motor systems.

- **Neuroglia (Glial Cells)**:
  - Supporting cells; do not conduct impulses.
  - Types of Neuroglia:
    - **Astrocytes**: Maintain blood-brain barrier.
    - **Oligodendrocytes**: Form myelin sheaths in CNS.
    - **Microglia**: Act as immune cells (macrophages) in the brain.
    - **Ependymal Cells**: Line ventricles and aid in forming CSF.

## Central Nervous System
- **Brain**:
  - Enclosed within the skull, consists of:
    - **Cerebrum**: Higher brain functions.
    - **Cerebellum**: Manages balance and coordination.
    - **Brainstem**: Connects brain to spinal cord.

- **Spinal Cord**:
  - Cylindrical structure enveloped by meninges.
  - Contains gray matter (cell bodies) centrally located and white matter (axons) peripherally.
  - Ends at L1-L2 vertebral levels in adults (L3 in newborns).
  - Has cervical and lumbar enlargements for upper and lower limb innervation.

## Peripheral Nervous System
- **Cranial Nerves**: 12 pairs originating from the brain; responsible for various sensory and motor functions.
- **Spinal Nerves**: 31 pairs; formed from dorsal (sensory) and ventral (motor) roots.
- **Dermatomes**: Areas of skin innervated by single spinal nerve; can overlap in certain areas (e.g., middle finger).

## Clinical Cases
- **Intervertebral Disc Herniation**: 
  - Caused by prolapse of nucleus pulposus through annulus fibrosus, potentially compressing spinal nerves and causing pain, weakness, or sensory loss.
  
- **Rhizotomy**: Surgical procedure to cut dorsal roots to alleviate pain from specific areas (e.g., middle finger).

## Key Terms
- **Ganglia**: Collection of neuron cell bodies; termed "nuclei" in CNS.
- **Saltatory Conduction**: Impulse transmission that "jumps" between nodes of Ranvier, facilitated by myelin sheaths.

## Additional Practice
- At the end of the slide deck, additional questions will be included to practice the concepts discussed in the lecture. The goal is to understand the connectivity and function of different parts of the nervous system, making the information easier to recall without extensive memorization.
